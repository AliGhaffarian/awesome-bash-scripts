## Eye Protector

The "eyeprotect" script is a simple shell script that helps to protect your eyes from prolonged screen exposure by reminding you to take regular breaks and look away from the screen. The script works by running a loop that waits for 20 minutes, turns off the screen for 20 seconds, and then turns it back on again. This cycle continues until the script is interrupted.

## Usage
```
chmod +x 202020.sh
./202020.sh
```
for cancel press `Ctrl+C`
