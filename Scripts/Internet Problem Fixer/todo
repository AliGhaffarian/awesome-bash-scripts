Hello, we want to write a complete script that will automatically check and solve the internet problem in Linux.

My opinion is that this process should be done step by step and each step should be checked to see if the internet problem is fixed or not.



My opinion is that we should use this road map. If you have a more complete or better method, please add it to this list.

+ The problem may be with the browser, so first we get a ping from a reliable site.
+ The user may have turned on the VPN and the VPN does not work.
+ The problem may be with the routing table.
+ The problem may be with the DNS, (fix : testing a reliable DNS)
+ The problem may be with the firewall (fix : disabele firewall and check again)
+ & ...




The fixer.sh script should be as simple as possible, we don't want to make anything complicated.
